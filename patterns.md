With a bit of fiddling, Tidal can be used to pattern the input to any
device which takes MIDI or Open Sound Control input, but the default
is the Dirt software sampler. If you followed the install process, you
should have Dirt installed and it should be running. 

This page shows you the basics of patterning, in particular how to
quickly define sequences (which can be polyphonic and polyrhythmic),
and how to use continuous patterns (sinewaves and the like).
