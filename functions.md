You can manipulate patterns using a wide variety of functions,
described below. Some will transform the time structure of the pattern
itself (e.g. make slower, faster), change the samples within the
pattern (e.g. chop them in to tiny bits) and others will combine two
patterns into a new one. You can use layer these functions on top of
each other to create weird interference patterns. Have fun with them!
