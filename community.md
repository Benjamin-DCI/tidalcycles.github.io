## TidalCycles q&a, forum and chat

For live discussion and chat, and probably the quickest route to a solution, there's an active `#tidal` channel (and also e.g. a `#tidal-innards` channel for those interested in meddling with tidal's internals and `#tidal-doc` for things interested in helping document tidal) on the [TOPLAP slack](http://toplap.org/toplap-on-slack/). You can also chat with people using other live coding environments there on the `#general` and other channels.

For in-depth discussion about TidalCycles, the official forum is at [lurk.org/groups/tidal](http://lurk.org/groups/tidal/), which is accessible both as a web forum and over email.

There is also the [Ask TidalCycles](http://ask.tidalcycles.org/) q&a website. Due to persistent spam, it is now readonly, but there is still much useful information there.
