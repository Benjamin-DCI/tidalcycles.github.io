The above instructions, and the rest of this document, assumes you're using the emacs editor. Emacs is a long-lived and rather complex beast. If you're new to emacs, you can bring up a tutorial by pressing `ctrl-h`, and then `t`. If you're looking for a VIM plugin, check <a href="http://lurk.org/groups/tidal/messages/topic/5F3bHtJPs6NRmm0b2VyQ8Z/">this forum thread</a>.
