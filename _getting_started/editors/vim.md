Vim is another classic programmer's editor, with a more minimalistic approach
than others, and famous for its peculiar and unique editing modes and hotkeys.

Because Vim doesn't have native support for REPLs or interactive buffers, the
[vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) plugin depends on
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), a terminal multiplexer, to communicate between
Vim and the Tidal interpreter.

See
[vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal/blob/master/README.md#vim-tidal)
for more information on how to install and use.
