This guide assumes you are performing somewhere with Tidal, on your own laptop, and that you want to project your screen.

# PA

Ask for stereo, and if it's a large room, for monitoring as well.

Stereo - One of Tidal's strengths is being able to do strange stereo cross-patterns. Some venues have mono systems, however. They may have two speakers, and tell you they have stereo sound, but when you get there you find everything is mono.. Either because it's wired as mono for some reason, or they only have a mono amp.

Monitoring - Even if you have stereo sound, you might not be able to hear it, because you've been placed behind the speakers (so the audience can hear you fine, but you can't), or because they're too far away in a large room. This might be workable (for some kinds of) DJs, but it makes improvising impossible if you can't hear properly. If you do have monitoring, again it might only be mono.

# Plugging in

If you just have your onboard laptop sound, then make sure you bring something like a "3.5mm Stereo Mini Jack to Twin RCA Phono Cable Lead", or a "1/8 inch TRS to Dual 1/4 Inch TS Cable". A couple of metres long and of reasonable quality, but don't get ripped off - it's just a wire. Here are a couple of suggestions:

* http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-CMP153-Cable-Inch-Dual/dp/B000068O3C
* http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007KN28BY/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2/277-0257037-9317524

If you have terrible onboard sound, or generally want pro quality with nice balanced 1/4" jack outputs, consider a sound module such as a Focusrite Scarlett (http://www.amazon.com/Focusrite-2i2-USB-Recording-Interface/dp/B005OZE9SA/ref=sr_1_2).

# Hum

This can be nasty. It could come from a 'ground loop', your laptop power supply, or the projector you're plugged into. Be sure to soundcheck with the projector plugged in, this can be a real problem. Try:

* unplugging the video cable - if it stops, it's the projector..
* unplugging your laptop power
* if you have a sound engineer, ask for a DI box with ground lift

Or it might be worth getting the latter in advance, e.g. the Behringer ultra di20.

# Packing up

There are a lot of videos on YouTube about how to coil cables so they don't break, *definitely* worth a watch.
