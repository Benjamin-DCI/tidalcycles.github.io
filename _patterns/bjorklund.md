If you give two numbers in parenthesis after an element in a pattern, then Tidal will
distribute the first number of sounds equally across the second number of steps:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "can(5,8)"
```

But then, it isn't possible to distrute three elements equally across eight discrete steps, but the
algorithm does the best it can. The result is a slightly funky bell pattern. Try this one:

```haskell
d1 $ sound "can(5,8)"
```

This uses "Bjorklund's algorithm", which wasn't made for music but for an application in nuclear physics, which is exciting. More exciting still is that it is very similar in structure to the one of the first known algorithms written in Euclid's book of elements in 300 BC. You can read more about this in the paper [The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) by Toussaint. Examples from this paper are included below, although some require rotation to start on a particular beat - see the paper for full details and references.
