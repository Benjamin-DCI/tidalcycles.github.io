All the samples can be found in the `samples` subfolder of the Dirt
distribution.  Here's some you could try:

~~~

printshort jazz voodoo birds3 procshort blip drum jvbass psr
wobble drumtraks koy rave bottle kurt latibro rm sax lighter lt
arpy feel less stab ul
~~~

Each one is a folder containing one or more wav files. For example
when you put `bd:1` in a sequence, you're picking up the second wav
file in the `bd` folder. If you ask for the ninth sample and there are
only seven in the folder, it'll wrap around and play the second one.

If you want to add your own samples, just create a new folder in the
samples director, and put `wav` files in it.
