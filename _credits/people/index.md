Thanks to everyone who has made music and other strange stuff with
Tidal over the years, contributing thoughts, ideas and questions which
have pushed it forward. You're all great.

TidalCycles and (Super)Dirt are created by [Alex McLean](http://yaxu.org), 
[Julian Rohrhuber](http://wertlos.org/~rohrhuber/), [Mike Hodnick](http://kindohm.com/), 
[Lennart Melzer](https://github.com/lennart), [David Ogborn](http://www.d0kt0r0.net/), [Ben Gold](https://github.com/bgold-cosmos), and [friends](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/graphs/contributors).

Its first proper free/open source release was supported by a
[L'ull Cec](https://lullcec.org/) residency at Hangar Barcelona.
