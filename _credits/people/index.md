Thanks to everyone who has made music and other strange stuff with
Tidal over the years, contributing thoughts, ideas and questions which
have pushed it forward. You're all great.

Tidal was brought into being by [Alex McLean](http://yaxu.org), with
many people joining the project to contribute to the code and
documentation including [Mike Hodnick](http://kindohm.com/) and
[Lennart Melzer](https://github.com/lennart).

Its first proper free/open source release was supported by a
[L'ull Cec](https://lullcec.org/) residency at Hangar Barcelona.
