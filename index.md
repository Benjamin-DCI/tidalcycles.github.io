TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a language for
<a href="http://toplap.org">live coding</a> patterns.<br class="visible-lg">
It allows you to make
musical patterns with text, describing sequences and ways of
transforming and combining them, exploring complex interactions
between simple parts.

  Tidal allows you to express music with very flexible timing, providing
  a little language for describing patterns as step sequences (which
  can be polyphonic and polymetric), some generators of continuous
  patterns (e.g. sinewaves, sawtooths) and a wide range of pattern
  transformations.
</p>
<p>
  Tidal is highly <em>composable</em> in that pattern
  transformations can be easily combined together, allowing you to
  quickly create complex patterns from simple ingredients.
</p>
<p>
  Tidal does not make sound itself, but is designed for use with the
  SuperDirt synth, and can control other synths over Open Sound Control
  or MIDI.

  Tidal is embedded in the Haskell language.<br>
  You don't have to learn
  Haskell to learn Tidal, but as you get deeper, it might help to pick
  up an introduction.<br>
  You could try Graham Hutton's "Programming in
  Haskell", Miran Lipovaƒça's
  <a title="which has a free online version" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn you a Haskell for Great Good</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Or, you could try learning just
  by playing with Tidal&hellip;
