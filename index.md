Domain specific language for live coding of pattern

Tidal is a language for live coding pattern, embedded in the Haskell language. You don't really have to learn Haskell to use Tidal, but it might help to pick up an introduction. You could try Graham Hutton's "Programming in Haskell" or Miran Lipovaƒça's [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/ "which has a free online version") . Or, you could try learning enough syntax to get by just by playing around with Tidal..
