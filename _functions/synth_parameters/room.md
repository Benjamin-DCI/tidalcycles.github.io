title: room and size
category: synth_parameters

Both `room` and `size` are patterns of numbers, representing the amount
of input into the reverb unit, and notional size of the room
respectively. These are only available in SuperDirt (not classic dirt)
and is a fully working but experimental feature which may change in
the future.
