~~~~ {haskell}
slow :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
~~~~

Slow down a pattern.

Example:

~~~~ {haskell}
d1 $ sound (slow 2 "bd sn kurt")
   # slow 3 (vowel "a e o")
~~~~

Slow also accepts numbers between 0 and 1, which causes the pattern to speed up:

~~~~ {haskell}
d1 $ sound (slow 0.5 "bd sn kurt")
   # slow 0.75 (vowel "a e o")
~~~~
