within :: Arc -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
~~~~

Use `within` to apply a function to only a part of a pattern. For example, to
apply `fast 2` to only the first half of a pattern:

~~~~haskell
d1 $ within (0, 0.5) (fast 2) $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
~~~~
{: .render }

Or, to apply `(# speed "0.5") to only the last quarter of a pattern:

~~~~haskell
d1 $ within (0.75, 1) (# speed "0.5") $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
~~~~
{: .render }
